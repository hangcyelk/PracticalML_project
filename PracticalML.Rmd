## Overview

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

## Data Loading and Processing


```{r}
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rattle)
library(randomForest)
library(corrplot)
library(gbm)

# set the URL for the download
UrlTrain <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
UrlTest  <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"

# download the datasets
training <- read.csv(url(UrlTrain))
testing  <- read.csv(url(UrlTest))

# create a partition with the training dataset 
inTrain  <- createDataPartition(training$classe, p=0.75, list=FALSE)
TrainSet <- training[inTrain, ]
TestSet  <- training[-inTrain, ]

# remove variables with Nearly Zero Variance
NZV <- nearZeroVar(TrainSet)
TrainSet <- TrainSet[, -NZV]
TestSet  <- TestSet[, -NZV]

# remove variables that are mostly NA
AllNA    <- sapply(TrainSet, function(x) mean(is.na(x))) > 0.95
TrainSet <- TrainSet[, AllNA==FALSE]
TestSet  <- TestSet[, AllNA==FALSE]

# remove identification only variables (columns 1 to 5)
TrainSet <- TrainSet[, -(1:5)]
TestSet  <- TestSet[, -(1:5)]
dim(TrainSet)
dim(TestSet)


```

With the cleaning process above, the number of variables for the analysis has been reduced to 54.

## Correlation Analysis
```{r}
corMatrix <- cor(TrainSet[, -54])
corrplot(corMatrix, order = "FPC", method = "color", type = "lower", 
         tl.cex = 0.8, tl.col = rgb(0, 0, 0))
```

The highly correlated variables are shown in dark colors in the graph above. 

## Prediction Model
Three methods will be applied to model the regressions (in the Train dataset) and the best one (with higher accuracy when applied to the Test dataset) will be used for the quiz predictions. The methods are: Random Forests, Decision Tree and Generalized Boosted Model, as described below.
A Confusion Matrix is plotted at the end of each analysis to better visualize the accuracy of the models.

# Random Forest
```{r}
# model fit
set.seed(12345)
controlRF <- trainControl(method="cv", number=4, verboseIter=FALSE)
modFitRandForest <- train(classe ~ ., data=TrainSet, method="rf",
                          trControl=controlRF)
modFitRandForest$finalModel
```

```{r}
# prediction on Test dataset
predictRandForest <- predict(modFitRandForest, newdata=TestSet)
confMatRandForest <- confusionMatrix(predictRandForest, as.factor(TestSet$classe))
confMatRandForest
```

```{r}
# plot matrix results
plot(confMatRandForest$table, col = confMatRandForest$byClass, 
     main = paste("Random Forest - Accuracy =",
                  round(confMatRandForest$overall['Accuracy'], 3)))
```


# Decision Tree
```{r}
# model fit
set.seed(12345)
modFitDecTree <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=TrainSet, method="class")
fancyRpartPlot(modFitDecTree)
```
```{r}
# prediction on Test dataset
predictDecTree <- predict(modFitDecTree, newdata=TestSet, type="class")
confMatDecTree <- confusionMatrix(predictDecTree, as.factor(TestSet$classe))
confMatDecTree
```

```{r}
# plot matrix results
plot(confMatDecTree$table, col = confMatDecTree$byClass, 
     main = paste("Decision Tree - Accuracy =",
                  round(confMatDecTree$overall['Accuracy'], 3)))
```

# Generalized Boosted Model
```{r}
# model fit
set.seed(12345)
controlGBM <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 5, repeats = 1)
modFitGBM  <- train(classe ~ ., data=TrainSet, method = "gbm",
                    trControl = controlGBM, verbose = FALSE)
modFitGBM$finalModel
```

```{r}
# prediction on Test dataset
predictGBM <- predict(modFitGBM, newdata=TestSet)
confMatGBM <- confusionMatrix(predictGBM, as.factor(TestSet$classe))
confMatGBM
```

```{r}
# plot matrix results
plot(confMatGBM$table, col = confMatGBM$byClass, 
     main = paste("GBM - Accuracy =", round(confMatGBM$overall['Accuracy'], 3)))
```

The accuracy of the three regression modeling methods above are:

Random Forest > GBM > Decision Tree

In that case, the Random Forest model will be applied to predict the test dataset as shown below.
```{r}
predictTest <- predict(modFitRandForest, newdata=testing)
predictTest
```
